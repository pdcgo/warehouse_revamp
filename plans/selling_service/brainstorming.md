# Brainstorming — Selling + Order domain (#23)

> Planning doc for the **selling service and the order service** (#23 says the selling work
> *"includes order service"*). Nothing here is implemented, and **nothing is decided** — this
> maps the domain, the real forks, and a proposed break-up into smaller issues (as #23 asks:
> *"break this to many issues if too big"*).

> **Decisions so far**
> - **CREATE, not adapt** — the selling/order/revenue domains are designed from first principles,
>   no other repo read (§3.1 settled). (owner, 2026-07-15)
> - **Decomposed into sub-issues** — the §4 break-up was created as GitHub issues on the board
>   (owner: "create all of them"). Shop management is Ready; the rest are Backlog behind the
>   decisions/§1 dependency. (owner, 2026-07-15)
> - **§3.5 Shops SETTLED (#66)** — a new **`selling_service`** owns `shops` (team-scoped to a
>   SELLING team). Shape: `name` (required), `shop_code` (unique per team, like team_code),
>   `marketplace` (a typed **enum** → `MarketplaceSelect`: Shopee/Tokopedia/Lazada/TikTok/Blibli/
>   Bukalapak/Other), `description`. **No credentials/integration metadata** — "just save shop
>   info"; the marketplace-integration secret story waits for import (#73). Managed by team
>   owner/admin (+ root/admin). (owner, 2026-07-15)
> - **§3.2/§3.3/§3.4/§3.7 for #67 — provisionally DECIDED BY THE AGENT (owner delegated overnight
>   2026-07-15; please review at 06:00 and redirect if wrong).** Orders live in **`selling_service`**
>   (it "will grow to own orders"), a new `warehouse.selling.v1.OrderService`.
>   - **Statuses (§3.2):** selling-side only — `ORDER_STATUS_PLACED` / `CONFIRMED` / `CANCELLED`.
>     The fulfillment states (picking→packed→shipped→delivered) are deliberately absent until the
>     warehouse core (plan.md §1) is designed.
>   - **Stock (§3.3):** `OrderCreate` does **NOT** touch inventory — no reservation, no decrement.
>     Stock integration is its own issue (#69), so this decision stays reversible.
>   - **Intake (§3.4):** manual create only; no marketplace import / external ref yet (that is #73).
>   - **Money (§3.7):** stored as **int64 whole rupiah**. The order FREEZES `subtotal` +
>     `shipping_cost` + `total`; each line snapshots `product_id`/`sku`/`name`/`quantity`/`unit_price`.
>     COGS / margin / fees are the revenue side (#74), not here.
>   - **Shape:** `order` (team_id scope, shop_id, status, customer name/phone/address, shipping_code,
>     the three money totals) + `order_items` (the line snapshots). No FKs across services (shop_id,
>     product_id are opaque). #67 ships the backend (model + OrderCreate/List/Detail); the UI is #68.
> - **#68 + #90 order UI shipped (agent, overnight 2026-07-15).** Orders list + read-only detail
>   (#68), then the create form (#90): customer + shop + shipping + dynamic product lines, subtotal
>   auto-summed, total = subtotal + shipping. Two new shared pickers — `ShopSelect` (bounded
>   NativeSelect over the team's shops) and `ProductSelect` (searchable Combobox over the catalogue).
>   **Design finding:** a product has **no catalogue price** (sku/name/category/images only), so the
>   order line's `unit_price` is **typed by the CS person** — which is right anyway, since the
>   buyer-paid price on a marketplace varies by shop/promo and the order FREEZES whatever was agreed.
>   If a default/list price is ever wanted, it belongs on the product (a new field), not invented here.
> - Still **open** and need the owner: §3.6 (which warehouse fulfils — needs §1) and the whole
>   revenue side (#32 / §3.7 downstream).

## 1. What already exists (ground truth)

The pieces an order sits on top of are mostly built:

| Domain | Service | What it gives an order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Catalogue | `product_service` | the products an order's lines reference |
| Stock | `inventory_service` | `StockReceive/List/History/Adjust/Transfer` — where an order decrements stock |
| Couriers | `shipping_service` | the shipping method an order ships with |
| Category | `category_service` | product taxonomy |
| Teams | `team_service` | selling teams **and** warehouse teams (a warehouse is a team of type WAREHOUSE) |
| Identity | `user_service` | who places / fulfils / manages orders |
| Files | `document_service` | proof images (payment, packing) |
| Events | `pkgs/event_source` | the bus an order lifecycle would publish onto |

**Missing, and in scope here:** *shops* (a selling team's marketplace storefronts), *orders* (the
lifecycle), and — downstream, #32 — *revenue*.

---

## 2. The shape of the domain (first principles)

A **selling team** sells goods that physically live as stock in a **warehouse**, through **shops**
(marketplace storefronts). The unit of work is the **order**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    C[Customer] -->|places| O[Order]
    O -->|lines reference| P[product_service]
    O -->|decrements| I[inventory_service]
    O -->|ships via| S[shipping_service]
    O -->|fulfilled by| W[a WAREHOUSE team]
    O -->|money| R[revenue_service · #32]
    subgraph selling side
      C
      O
    end
    subgraph warehouse side — undesigned §1
      W
    end
```

An order has **two halves**, and they pull in different directions:

- **Selling side** — placed, customer + address, payment, which shop, the money the buyer pays.
  This is designable now.
- **Warehouse side** — pick → pack → hand to courier. This is **fulfillment**, and it needs the
  warehouse operation, which is **[plans/plan.md](../plan.md) §1 — still empty.** We cannot design
  the fulfillment lifecycle until we know what a warehouse physically does.

> **This split is the single most important thing on this page.** The selling half can move; the
> fulfillment half is blocked on the warehouse-core design. A good decomposition (§4) puts them in
> different issues so the selling half is not held hostage.

## 3. The forks — decisions the owner must make

Presented as options, **not settled** (HARD RULE 8).

### 3.1 Create, or Adapt? ⭐ *answer this first*
#23/#32 say *"Create or Adapt."* Neither issue names a reference system, so by default (HARD
RULE 1) this is a **clean-slate design from first principles.** If instead you want to **adapt an
existing selling/order/revenue implementation**, say so explicitly — then I'd study it the way I
did for `user_service` / `team_service`, and this plan becomes a port-spec instead.

- [ ] **Create (clean slate)** — design from the warehouse and the people, as we've been doing.
- [ ] **Adapt** — name the source and I'll read it (needs your explicit go-ahead per HARD RULE 1).

### 3.2 What is the order lifecycle? ⚠ *depends on the warehouse core (§1)*
The status model is the spine of the order service. The forward path is roughly
`placed → confirmed → picking → packed → shipped → delivered`, plus the tails `cancel`,
`return`, `problem`. But the middle (`picking → packed → shipped`) **is** the warehouse operation.
Until §1 is designed, we can only fix the selling-side ends (`placed`, `confirmed`, `cancel`) and
leave the fulfillment states as a marked gap.

> **Implemented — the selling-side ends (#91).** `OrderConfirm` (PLACED→CONFIRMED) and `OrderCancel`
> (PLACED or CONFIRMED→CANCELLED, terminal) are built, with the row locked FOR UPDATE so a concurrent
> confirm/cancel can't race, and illegal moves rejected as `FailedPrecondition`. **No stock/money is
> reversed on cancel** — that is #70, once stock integration (#69) lands. The `picking→packed→shipped`
> fulfillment states are still absent, pending §1.
>
> ```mermaid
> stateDiagram-v2
>     [*] --> PLACED: OrderCreate
>     PLACED --> CONFIRMED: OrderConfirm
>     PLACED --> CANCELLED: OrderCancel
>     CONFIRMED --> CANCELLED: OrderCancel
>     CONFIRMED --> fulfillment: (§1 — undesigned)
>     CANCELLED --> [*]
> ```

### 3.3 When does an order take stock?
Three honest options, and it ties to the reservation question already open in
[plans/plan.md §4.4](../plan.md):

| Option | When stock leaves | Trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Deduct at placement** ✅ | immediately | simplest; oversell impossible; but a cancel must return stock |
| **Reserve** at placement, deduct at pick | held, then taken | needs a reservation concept inventory doesn't have yet |
| Deduct at pick only | when the warehouse picks | stock looks available until picked → oversell risk |

**✅ DECIDED (owner, 2026-07-20): deduct at PLACEMENT.** Stock leaves the moment the order is placed
(#69), so **the number on screen is the number you have** — oversell is impossible by construction
rather than by luck. That is the same stance the warehouse side has taken throughout: never let a
number say something nobody observed.

**✅ And how the two services talk (owner, 2026-07-20): SYNCHRONOUS RPC, stock first, then the order.**
This is the **first service-to-service call in the system** — nothing called anything before it — so it
sets the pattern the next one inherits, and it was chosen deliberately rather than by default.

The decision only looks like plumbing. It is actually what makes "deduct at placement" *true*:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Sync RPC** ✅ | the deduct happens **before** the order exists. Not enough stock → no order. The guarantee holds. |
| Event (Pub/Sub) | the order is written, the deduct lands moments later — so two orders placed in the same second are both accepted, and **that is an oversell**. It would have quietly undone the decision above. |

The event path was tempting because `pkgs/event_source` already exists and it keeps the services more
independent. It was rejected for this call specifically, **not in general** — an event is right for
telling other services something *has happened*; it is wrong for asking permission, and a stock deduct
is asking permission.

**The cost, stated plainly:** two databases, no shared transaction. If the order write fails *after* a
successful deduct, stock is decremented for an order that does not exist. That is recoverable — the
movement is in the ledger with a reason, so it can be found and reversed — but it needs a compensating
reversal rather than a rollback, and #70's cancel path is the same machinery. This is the classic
distributed-write trade, taken with open eyes: a rare recoverable inconsistency beats a routine
oversell.

- The cost is real and accepted: **a cancel must put the stock back**, which is #70. It is a small
  cost, and unlike an oversell it is a thing the system can do correctly.
- **Reservation was rejected for now, not forever.** It is the truest model — goods sit on the shelf
  until someone picks them — but inventory has no reservation concept, so it means a new on-hand vs
  available split touching every stock read. Revisit it if picking (§1, #71) ever needs to know what
  is spoken for. Until then, "available" and "on hand" being the same number is a simplification the
  system is honest about rather than a thing it gets wrong.

### 3.4 Where do orders come from (intake)?
- Manual entry (a CS person types it in).
- Marketplace **import** (is the `bargawa` Chrome extension the intake path? it already speaks the
  Connect contract).
- A public order-create API.

Each implies different `OrderCreate` ergonomics and a different `source`/`ref_id` story.

**✅ DECIDED (owner, 2026-07-20): manual entry only, for now** (#73). A CS person types the order in,
which is exactly what `OrderCreate` + the #90 form already do — so **#73 needs no new code**, and its
value was in the decision rather than the build.

- **Marketplace import and a public API are NOT rejected, just not now.** Both remain in §3.4 as
  future paths, and the `source`/`ref_id` story stays unwritten until one is chosen — inventing it
  ahead of a real import would be guessing at a shape nobody has seen.
- Worth remembering when import does arrive: the implementation finding in §3.7 below says the server
  cannot safely assert `total == subtotal + shipping`, because a marketplace's buyer-paid total
  legitimately differs (vouchers, subsidies, coins). Manual entry is the case where that arithmetic
  *would* hold — so an import is what forces the `discount`/`fee` fields, not the other way round.

### 3.5 Shops — what is a shop, and does selling own it?
A selling team likely operates several marketplace shops. Minimum shape: name, marketplace type,
maybe credentials/metadata. Does `shop` belong to a new `selling_service`, or is it its own
service? Who can manage shops (team owner/admin)?

### 3.6 Which warehouse fulfils an order, and how does the crew see it?
Per-order choice? A shop default? Auto-pick by stock? And the warehouse crew's fulfillment
screen is **§1 territory** again.

**✅ DECIDED (owner, 2026-07-20): chosen PER ORDER** (#72). Whoever types the order picks the
warehouse, and the order stores it. Nothing is inferred.

This had to be settled before #69 could exist at all: "deduct at placement" is meaningless until an
order says *which warehouse to deduct from*, and an `Order` had no `warehouse_id` — the proto said so
explicitly, deferring it to §1.

- **A shop default was the tempting alternative** and was not taken: it is less typing, but it infers
  a physical fact from a configuration value, and a shop's default changing later would silently make
  old orders read as if they had shipped from somewhere they did not. Per-order is one more field and
  no inference.
- **Auto-by-stock was rejected as underspecified rather than wrong.** It needs rules nobody has: what
  if two warehouses qualify, what if none can fill the order alone, is a split across warehouses one
  order or two. Those are worth answering when volume demands it — and the per-order field is what an
  auto-picker would *fill in* later, so this decision does not block it.
- The warehouse crew's **fulfilment screen** is still §1 territory (#71) and untouched by this.

### 3.7 The money the order records (feeds #32)
What does an order freeze for the revenue side — buyer-paid total, COGS, shipping cost, warehouse
fee, marketplace fee? This is the seam between #23 and #32.

> **Implementation finding (#90).** `OrderCreate` currently **trusts** the client's `subtotal` /
> `shipping_cost` / `total` — it stores them verbatim, it does not recompute from the lines. The #90
> form always sends derived-consistent values (`subtotal = Σ qty·unit_price`, `total = subtotal +
> shipping`), so manual orders are safe today. But we deliberately did **not** add a server-side
> `total == subtotal + shipping` check, because on a marketplace the buyer-paid total legitimately
> **differs** from `Σ lines` (platform vouchers, free-shipping subsidies, coins). So the real fork for
> #74 is: **introduce explicit `discount` / `fee` fields** and then the server can enforce an
> invariant — until then there is no arithmetic the server can safely assert. Decide this before
> marketplace import (#73) starts feeding in real payout numbers.

## 4. Proposed decomposition into issues

#23 explicitly asks to break this up. A proposed set — **for the owner to confirm before any are
created** (I won't create issues unilaterally):

**Movable now (selling side, not blocked on §1):**
1. **Shop management** — `shop` model + CRUD RPCs + a selling-team Shops screen.
2. **Order data model + `OrderCreate`** — place an order (lines, customer, shop, shipping),
   selling-side statuses only.
3. **Order list + detail (selling view)** — the CS/selling screens.
4. **Stock integration on order** — decrement inventory per §3.3's chosen timing.
5. **Order cancel** — reverse stock + money.

**Blocked on the warehouse core (§1):**
6. **Order fulfillment (warehouse side)** — the pick → pack → ship lifecycle and the crew screen.
7. **Which-warehouse routing** — depends on how warehouses are operated.

**Downstream (#32):**
8. **Revenue recording** — what an order freezes and how it reconciles (its own epic).
9. **Order intake / marketplace import** — depends on §3.4.

---

## 5. The honest blocker

Half of "orders" is warehouse fulfillment, and **the warehouse operation has never been designed**
— [plans/plan.md §1](../plan.md) (who works there, the jobs, the devices, whether anything is
barcoded) is empty. The selling half (shops, order-create, order list/detail, cancel) can proceed
first; the fulfillment half cannot be planned well until §1 is filled in with the owner.

**So the two most useful next moves, in order:**
1. Answer §3.1 (Create vs Adapt) — it decides whether this is a clean-slate design or a port-spec.
2. Fill in [plans/plan.md §1](../plan.md) — the warehouse jobs — which unblocks the fulfillment
   half of every order issue, and #32.
